/*
Que.  How do you reset state when a component unmounts?
Ans.  ðŸš¨ Problem: This approach does NOT work because you cannot update state of an unmounted component. 
                   Instead, use one of the following alternatives.

    ðŸ”¥ Best Approach?
    1. âœ… For Child components: Unmount child from the parent component.
    2. âœ… For forceful resets: Change the key prop of the component.
    3. âœ… For React Router apps: Reset state based on location.pathname.
