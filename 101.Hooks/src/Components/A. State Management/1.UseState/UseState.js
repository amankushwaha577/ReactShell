/*
Definition : Hooks are functions that allows us to work with state and lifecycle methods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UseState() : This Hook allows us to manage and Hold state.
A. Takes an initial value as an argument and Returns array containing 2 values :
   [ state , function to change state ].

B. State Setter Function is Used to update state.
   a). state can't be update directly. 
       If we do x ="Aman Kushwaha"  state will change but it will not trigger re-render. So UI will not update.

   b). Re-renders: Every state change triggers a re-render of the component.

   c). Updating state with the same value doesn’t trigger a re-render.

   d). React batches updates inside event handlers.
