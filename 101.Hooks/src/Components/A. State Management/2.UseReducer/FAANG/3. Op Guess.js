/*
Que. ðŸ‘‰ What happens if the button is clicked twice?
Ans. Reducer called with: 0 
     Component render with: 1

     Reducer called with: 1
     Component render with: 2

    ðŸ“Œ The reducer executes before React updates the component! 
    When we fire dispatch first reducer executes than it re-renders the components who is consuming state
