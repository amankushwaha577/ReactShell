// Purpose: 
// ---------------
// Optimizes performance by memoizing values, recalculates only when dependencies change.


// Syntax: 
// ---------------
// const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);


// When to Use:
// 1. Expensive calculations that donâ€™t need to run on every render.
// 2. Preventing re-renders in child components by avoiding re-creation of functions or objects passed as props.
    // Suppose we are passing functions as a prop in Child Component and supppose a render happened in parent in this time 
    // Parent will again recreate the same function and this time its reference will be changed. So Child will think its prop is changed
    // And it will re render itself. It caused unnnecessary re-render in Child To avoid this swrap useMemo to function with dependecies.
